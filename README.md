# Spleeter to Multichannel
Converts a stereo song or movie audio track separated by Deezer Spleeter to 7.1 surround sound.
This software is not a GUI for the entire Spleeter process.
Use [SpleeterGui by boy1dr](https://github.com/boy1dr/SpleeterGui) for the creation of 4- or 5-stem splits of any audio, then load the result folder into this application.
Each track is configurable for multiple upmixing matrices and LFE mixing, the default setting being the best option for front-to-rear volume reduction for most sources.
